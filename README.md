# Minecraft-Style 3D Maze with SOR Modeler

## Overview
C++ / OpenGL based 3D maze game with a custom SOR (Surface of Revolution) modeler.
Implements real-time rendering, collision detection, texture mapping, and lighting.

## Tech Stack
C++, OpenGL, FreeGLUT, BMP Texture Mapping, Windows API (Sound)

## Key Features
- Custom SOR mesh generation (axis-based rotation)
- First-person movement with collision handling
- BMP texture mapping (walls, lava, sky)
- Dynamic lighting & material shading
- Floating item animation (sin-based motion)
- Sound system integration

## Technical Challenges
- Fixed incorrect vertex connections in rotational mesh
- Solved BMP 24-bit format and texture distortion issues
- Reconstructed polygon indexing for model import
